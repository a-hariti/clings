# 18 Memory Layout

Understand how data is laid out in memory: alignment, padding, and offsets.
This chapter connects structs, arrays, and pointer arithmetic with the actual
layout chosen by the compiler.

Topics:
- Alignment and padding rules
- `offsetof` and field ordering
- Stack vs heap layout expectations
