# Variables

In C, every variable must be declared with a type before it can be used. This tells the compiler how much memory to allocate and how to interpret the data.

## Exercise: variables1

The goal of this exercise is to fix the variable declaration so the program compiles.

Common types include:
- `int`: Integer numbers (e.g., 1, -5, 42)
- `float`: Floating-point numbers (e.g., 3.14, -0.01)
- `char`: Single characters (e.g., 'a', 'Z')
