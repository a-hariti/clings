# Structs

Structs (short for structures) allow you to group multiple variables of different types under a single name. This is essential for creating complex data types.

When dealing with structs, you use the dot operator (`.`) to access members if you have the struct instance itself. If you have a pointer to a struct, you use the arrow operator (`->`).
